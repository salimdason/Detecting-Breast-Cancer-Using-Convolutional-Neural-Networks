Demonstrative CNN for breast cancer detection

Breast Cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, with nearly 2 million new cases in 2018 according to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Globally, breast cancer now represents one in four of all cancers in women. Since 2008, worldwide breast cancer incidence has increased by more than 20 percent. Mortality has increased by 14 percent.

Tumors can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Benign tumors tend to grow slowly and do not spread. Malignant tumors can grow rapidly, invade and destroy nearby normal tissues, and spread throughout the body.

With the use of deep neural networks, the accuracy of early Breast Cancer detection could be improved significantly, hence this basic CNN model.
